# Lab 04: Microcontrollers, Sensors, and Actuators

## What We Did in The Last Lab

In the previous lab, we delved into digital circuit design, starting with the creation of a 2 to 1 mux using fundamental logic gates like AND, OR, and NOT gates. Progressing further, a 74150 mux chip was utilized to construct a 4 to 1 mux, meticulously wiring based on comprehensive diagrams and documentation. Integrating Arduino, it was employed to control and test the mux's functionality, programming it to manage input data and control lines while validating output accuracy through systematic testing. Lastly, a 1-bit adder circuit was designed and implemented, showcasing proficiency in combining logic gates for arithmetic operations.

## Overview and Motivation
In this lab, we'll use the arduino microcontroller to communicate and interact with our surrondings. This lab is broken into five different parts. Four of which are exploratory exercises, where we will learn about and use two sensors and two actuators. These include a Buzzer, a Servo, a Ultrasonic Sensor, and a Photoresistor. The Buzzer is an actuator that produces a sound when there are changes in the environment. The Servo is a motor that reacts pulses it gets from the arduino controller. The Ultrasonic Sensor, similar to a sonar radar, uses sonar to measaur distance. The Photoresistor measures how bright a light is. The fifth section of the lab will consists of a design challege. We will choose between a light detector, a distance detector, or a mechanical light follower and design and implement that project. The challenge is developing our own code for the arduino controller, along with devloping our own design to build one of the projects listed above.
